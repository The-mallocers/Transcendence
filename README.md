## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Transcendence
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   make up
   ```
   Notes: We will install Django as part of the build process, but its just to generate the env.
   This will build and start all containers. The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

##### Make up will execute the following commands if it's the first time you run it:
1. Create the necessary secret files:
   ```bash
   make secrets
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your 42 API client ID and secret, if you arent a 42 student, feel free to skip this.

2. Generate the environment file:
   ```bash
   make env
   ```
   This will create a `.env` file with all necessary configuration.

3. (Optional) Update passwords:
   ```bash
   make passwords
   ```
   This allows you to set custom passwords for the admin user, database, and Grafana.
